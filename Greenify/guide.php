                <h2>Recycle</h2>
                <p>Recycle everything you possibly can, 
                    all plastic, metal, paper and glass. 
                    In most places there are recycling bins in every neighbourhood. 
                    By reducing air and water pollution and saving energy, recycling 
                    offers an important environmental benefit: it reduces emissions 
                    of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous 
                    oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, that contribute to global climate change.</p>
